**This file uses Matplotlib and Pandas to perform an analysis of Pymaceutical's anti-cancer animal study- an experimental mice study using various anti-cancer drug regimens designed as potential treatments of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Selected drug regimens' performance and effectiveness are evaluated over a 45 day course and represented within tables and figures in the study report.**


* Script includes
    * Clean data of duplicate experimental data points  
    * Create table of summary statistics including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error 
    * Generate bar, line, pie, scatter and box plots using Matplotlib and Pandas
    * Calculate quartiles including interquartile ranges, and determine outliers for box and whisker plot
    * Use linear regression to obtain correlation coefficient and slope intercept equations 
    * Merge and manipulate data into and within dataframes
