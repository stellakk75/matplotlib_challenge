# Matplotlib_challenge


**This file uses Matplotlib and Pandas to perform an analysis of an animal studies experiment on various drug regimens designed as potential treatments of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Selected drug regimens' performance and effectiveness are evaluated and represented within tables, charts and figures in the study report.**


* Script includes
    * Clean data of duplicate experimental data points  
    * Create table of summary statistics including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error 
    * Generate bar, line, pie, scatter and box plots using Matplotlib and Pandas
    * Calculate quartiles including interquartile ranges, and determine outliers for box and whisker plot
    * Use linear regression to obtain correlation coefficient and slope intercept equations 
    * Merge and manipulate data into and within dataframes
